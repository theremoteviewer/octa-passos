A remixer for the Elektron Octatrack's operating system: pick the
modifications you want and build them into one firmware image from your
own copy of OS 1.40C.

A modification is a **module** (`modules/<name>/`), a selection of modules
is a **remix** (`remixes/<name>.py`), and `make image REMIX=<name>` composes
a remix into a card-flashable image: placing code, wiring hooks by symbol,
refusing collisions by name, and proving every ported module against its
author's own build byte for byte. No firmware is distributed here; every
image is derived from the user's own 1.40C on the user's machine.

**[docs/remixes/BUILDING.md](docs/remixes/BUILDING.md)** is the step-by-step
guide from a fresh machine to a flashed unit.
**[docs/remixes/README.md](docs/remixes/README.md)** lists every remix with
its contents and hardware status.

## What it carries

Every module, with its author. Those with a repository are built from it.

| module | author | what it does | proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MIDI SCENES** | [bkkbrls-del/midisc](https://github.com/bkkbrls-del/midisc) | per-scene parameter locks driven over MIDI | his sources (submodule, GNU-as form), twelve units in DRAM, 38 detours, 4 pokes; every region equals his encoder's bytes |
| **USB MIDI** | [markandrus/octemu](https://github.com/markandrus/octemu) | class-compliant USB-MIDI in and out on the OT's own USB port, mirroring DIN: the firmware's dormant transmit encoder wired in, a receive decoder into its MIDI path | his shims as a DRAM unit, seven detours, four pointer rewrites; enumerates, receives and transmits under the ColdFire port (`verify_usb`); not on hardware |
| **USB AUDIO** | [markandrus/octemu](https://github.com/markandrus/octemu) | the tracks (post-FX pre-fader), MAIN and CUE over USB: 20 channels of 24-bit UAC2, the tracks' stereo sum at full speed | his producer, packet builder and servo as a DRAM unit on the loader instead of his card payload; streams 22/23-frame packets at the device's poll cadence under the port; not on hardware |
| **OCTAKIT** | [emuyia/ems-octakit](https://github.com/emuyia/ems-octakit) | 256 Kits per Project in place of 64 bank-tied Parts, with names, copy/paste, undo, migration of old projects | her recipe (submodule) compiled, packed and appended by the build; stock + her writes + her append reproduces her own OS image |
| **LOFI AMF FIX** | [bryantysinger/octa-bt-pt](https://github.com/bryantysinger/octa-bt-pt) | stock LO-FI's AMF knob jumps the pitch backwards at some settings; two DSP words fix it | both words disassembled against stock |
| **REPITCH** | [repeat98](https://github.com/repeat98) | a fifth TSTR value: the track follows the project tempo by playback speed, no grains; PTCH off on that track | ColdFire unit + a 5-position TSTR widget; on an MKII (OCTABAM81, 16 Sep 2026); `tools/verify/verify_repitch.py` |
| **BusVerb / BusDelay / Send** | [sambanks](https://github.com/sambanks) | one aux bus: every track's SEND knob → a multi-mode delay → an eight-line FDN reverb, each engine's wet on the track that hosts it. A route the stock firmware has no path for | on Sam's MKII |
| **Spectrum / Character / Modulation** | [sambanks](https://github.com/sambanks) | three FX1 stations replacing FILTER, LO-FI and CHORUS: a filter pedal, a saturation/compressor/width chain, a modulation pedal | on Sam's MKII |
| **WarpFold, Ripple, Rungs, Streamz, BodeShift, Nimbus** | [sambanks](https://github.com/sambanks) | six Mutable-Instruments-flavoured per-track inserts that stack | local render; never flashed |
| **TEMPO SYNC, CC MAP, MODE DEFAULTS** | [sambanks](https://github.com/sambanks) | ColdFire patches: BusDelay's TIME reads as a division; MIDI CC 62–73 reach page-2 knobs; a MODE turned on the panel (or over CC) re-defaults the knobs around it from the module's views | on the unit |
| **FLEX SEEK BIND, FLEX SEEK BIND CTR, RECORDER SPACING** | [sambanks](https://github.com/sambanks) | the recorder click fix: three ColdFire caves that remove the click at a recorder loop's seam; remix `recfix` carries them beside the stock chooser | on hardware (OCTABAM83, 12 Sep 2026) |
| **KITS RELOAD, SCENES KITS** | [sambanks](https://github.com/sambanks) | bridges that let byte-disjoint but behaviourally colliding modules share an image: MIDI SCENES' Part Reload beside Octakit's kit reload (the first `ok-ms` image trapped on the first reload without it); CC MAP and Octakit sharing the MIDI CC dispatch entry. `make modules` marks a pair that needs one with `✓*` | `ok-ms` on hardware 14 Sep 2026, confirmed by midisc's author on his unit |
| **HELLO WORLD, HELLO DRAM** | [sambanks](https://github.com/sambanks) | the two reference modules, one DSP knob and one DRAM unit, kept building as canaries | `make check` |

`make modules` prints the index, the compatibility matrix (which ColdFire
modules can share an image, from the same check the build makes; `✓*` is a
pair that needs the named bridge) and every remix.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sambanks/octabam
cd octabam
make setup                          # toolchain (macOS + Homebrew; docs/WSL.md for Linux)
make os && make recon               # your own 1.40C -> out/raw/section_3_MAIN_OS.bin
make image REMIX=ok-ms BUILD=1      # -> out/OCTATRACK_OCTABAM1.bin
```

`make check REMIX=<name>` runs every gate and boots the image under the
local ColdFire emulator. `make remix` opens the TUI remixer
(`docs/remixer/REMIXER.md`).

## How it works

```
modules/<name>/manifest.py   what a module is and what it claims (yours, or a pointer into an author's repo)
remixes/<name>.py            which modules, in which chooser order
tools/remix/ledger.py        refuses two modules that claim one address, hook, id or buffer, by name
tools/build/build_bus.py     the build: assembles, links, places, wires, verifies -> out/mainos_bus.bin
tools/verify/*               the gates: oracles, the boot under the ColdFire port, menu, cycles, identity
```

A module's code lands in one of three places; the build decides which bytes
go where, and a module declares what it is, not an address:

| class | declared as | where |
|---|---|---|
| ROM cave | `CavePatch`: a `.s` source, or ratified hex | one of the OS image's free zero runs, ~8 KB total shared by everyone |
| DRAM unit | `Linked(..., dram=True)`: a GNU-as unit | linked with every other DRAM unit in the remix into one runtime, packed, appended behind octabam's loader, depacked at boot into a 10 MB reserve carved off stock's 85.5 MB sample/recorder pool |
| appended runtime | `Runtime`: a recipe (Octakit's `firmware.json`) | its own reserve of the same pool, as a second payload of the same loader |

The OS-image edits every class needs — a detour at a stock instruction, a
poke, a grown table — are `Detour`, `Poke`, `TableGrow`, wired by symbol and
asserted against stock before a byte is written. `docs/remixer/PLACEMENT.md`
is the map of what is free and what was measured.

**A port is a proof.** The build re-links every unit at the author's own
address and compares, rebuilds Octakit's runtime to the identities her
recipe pins, and refuses on any drift. `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the contract;
`docs/remixer/MODULES.md` the guide to writing a module.

## Checking without a flash

The DSP side renders locally on the assembled instruction stream (`make
render`, `make render-rig`; `docs/remixer/HARNESS.md`); the ColdFire side
boots the built image under a headless port of the machine (`make emu-cf`;
`docs/remixer/EMU.md`) and, for the firmware's own screens, under
Unicorn (`docs/remixer/EMU.md`). What the emulators cannot see — caches, the
recorder, cross-core timing — is listed beside every gate that is blind to
it.

## Before you flash anything

**Writing a non-official OS to an Octatrack can leave it unusable and puts
your warranty in question.** Nothing here is endorsed by, supported by, or
affiliated with Elektron. `docs/remixer/FLASHING.md` has the recovery path;
`docs/remixer/FAILURE_MODES.md` is the register of what has gone wrong on a
unit and why. Back up projects before flashing anything that changes them
(Octakit migrates Parts to Kits on load; downgrading may lose Kit data).

MKI and MKII run the same 1.40C image (hash-verified). sambanks's effects
have only been tested on an MKII; the DRAM platform has run on an MKI ([octalab](https://github.com/nordseele/octalab-notes), 11 Sep 2026)
and on midisc's author's unit (`ok-ms`, 14 Sep 2026).

**No Elektron binary is redistributed here, and none may be.** A built
`.bin` or `.syx` contains Elektron's OS: do not share built images. Share
the repo; everyone builds their own.

**Em** ([emuyia](https://github.com/emuyia)) designed Octakit and the
loader-appended DRAM runtime octabam adopted as its large-payload placement;
`tools/remix/loader.S` is derived from hers with attribution. Her repository
invites use as a submodule to combine with other efforts.

This began as a fork of [mxldyn/octamax](https://github.com/mxldyn/octamax)
by Maxolydian, whose reverse engineering of the OS format, memory map and
parameter tables made any of this reachable; the upstream history is in
this repository's log.
