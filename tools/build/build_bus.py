"""THE build: a remix and the user's stock OS image -> out/mainos_bus.bin.

    REMIX=<name> [BUILD=nn] [XBUS=1 SPEC=1 DEV=1 ...] python3 tools/build/build_bus.py

Assembles every selected DSP module, places it in the donor region (the
three stock reverbs' P code, and any other stock effect on neither chooser)
of each payload, writes the FX2/FX1 choosers and the descriptor clones,
installs every ColdFire cave, detour, poke and table, links the DRAM units
into the platform runtime and appends it behind the loader with any other
payload, and prints a report every gate parses. `make bus` is XBUS=1
SPEC=1; `make check` runs the gates over it.

Module order in a payload is `DspSection.priority`; the report shows the
live word count per module and the region's FREE. The records are
contiguous in loaded P memory but separated by headers in the file, so a
stream spanning them is split per record on the way in; contiguity is
asserted, not assumed.

Payload A's half of the 64K shared window is 0x30000-0x37FFF and payload
B's 0x38000-0x3FFFF, so `_sub` rewrites the literal `$30000` to
PP[tag]["ybase"] in a module's source text before assembling. It is a
blanket string replace over the whole source, comments included, applied
under XBUS to SEND and REVERB SERVER as well as DELAY SERVER: a
shared-window address that must not move on payload B is spelled as an
offset from a register-held base, never as `$30000`, and the count of that
literal is censused.

# on FX1: there is no list to grow and no cave to relocate into. (That is
